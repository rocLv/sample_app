#Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application for rails 4.1.1


This is the sample application for the [*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](http://railstutorial.org/)
by [rocLv](http://roclv.github.io/).

This sample application is slightly different from the origin.

First, I used Rails 4.1.1, not Rails 4.0.

Second, I used bootstrap 3.0, not bootstrap 2. There are huge differnt between them.

This sample application are tested through Rspec.
